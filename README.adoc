= Java Database Cookbook Source Files

* You MUST HAVE Java 8 to successfully compile this whole package.

* Building with Eclipse tested with Eclipse 4.3; MUST HAVE "m2e" (free in the Eclipse Marketplace)
	Compiles and most tests pass; those with Hamcrest fail for me due to an obscure conflict:
	java.lang.SecurityException: class "org.hamcrest.Matchers"'s signer information does not 
		match signer information of other classes in the same package

* Building with Maven 3.x works and all tests pass.

* Building with other platforms? Good luck, but let me know if it works.
