= Contributing

First, thanks for wanting to contribute!

All you have to do is:

. Login to github;
. Fork the repository (button in the upper right);
. Download your forked copy or, if your change is simple, make it on the web interface.
. Run the tests. Add a test if the code you're changing doesn't have one yet. Make sure tests pass.
. Click the `Pull Requests` link at the top, and click `New Pull Request`.

Submitting a contribution here constitutes acceptance of licensing your code under the existing open source license.
You also warrant that you have the legal right to contribute your change.

Thanks for helping!
